This is a tutorial I'm following in order to learn how to convert a PSD file into HTML5.   

The tutorial can be found here: http://pixelhint.com/learn-how-to-convert-beautiful-website-from-psd-to-html5-css3/

I will use some new libraries which I haven't used before:
*Wow.js
*Animate.css
*Responsiveslides.js

It will also help me get more acustomed to Git as i haven't been using it lately.
